# GeneticAlgorithmProject
Personal Project implementing a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA), which seeks to converge to a given list as chosen by the user.
Further developments will involve running several simulations of this GA, and seeing the effects of the varying parameters. 

Can see the algorithm in action by running the 'ga.py' file, with 'goal', 'pop_size' and 'mut_chance' all being parameters that can be altered from the 'genetic_algorithm' function header.
